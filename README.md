power ranks very secret

i download the default batting/pitching/fielding csv's from fangraphs for team aggregates of the season and past 7 days

to run make a folder for the week thats just the week number and edit that one line at the top of rank.py and add the csv's for that week into the folder then run if it breaks it's your fault

no bully

stay flappy
